    <p>
        I am Tirthankar Ghosh, the Marketing man. I am 25 years old and am pursuing my Post Graduate Diploma in Management(equivalent to MBA) in Marketing

    <p>
        I am passionate about marketing. I believe that marketiing always help a society to achieve a high standard of living.<br/>
        With the help of marketing, We:
        <ol type="a">
            <li>identify the needs and problems of society</li>
            <li>craft product according to that information</li>
            <li>Communicate with the society through several channels to let them know that a solution is there for their problem</li>
            <li>Deliver the product in exchange of feedback or money</li>
        </ol>
        Thus, through marketing, we are identifying the problem in the society and helping them with the solution.
    </p>
    <p>
        That's why I believe in the potential of marketing.
